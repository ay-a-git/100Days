Days 1 - 21 will be added retroactively

Days 22 - onward are held 

Day 22 - was a lesson on using the dat.GUI to debug and design objects in a more visual manner.

Day 23 - was based on textures and the skins we can apply to objects. One of my main goals of this day was to learn to add a "video skin" to an object for the sake of a creative project in coming days. Essentially, i want to record video and have videos play on each side of a cube in real time.
